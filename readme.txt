Create a restaurant menu for cafes, bars and eateries, and display it in templates, posts, pages and widgets.

== Description ==

Create a restaurant menu for cafes, bars and eateries, and display it in templates, posts, pages and widgets.

This plugin creates two new post types, Menu Items and Menus, which can be used to easily construct a menu. Create items on your menu, group them into sections and then build menus out of them.

* Unlimited menus and menu items
* Add a photo and price for each menu item
* Menu sections can include guidance, such as "All entrees come with a side salad or fries"
* Display your menu with a simple shortcode
* Use the widget to display your menu in a sidebar
* Responsive menu layout to improve mobile viewing

= How to use =

Read the [documentation](http://themeofthecrop.com/docs/food-and-drink-menu "How to use the Food and Drink Menu plugin") for how to create your menus. Once you've created a menu you can use the widget to add it to a sidebar or include it in any page with a shortcode:

[fdm-menu id=123]

Once you've saved the menu in the admin panel, it will give you the shortcode so you don't need to go hunting for the id.
